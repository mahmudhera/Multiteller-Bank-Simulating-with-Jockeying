# Multiteller Bank Simulating with Jockeying
This is a C++ simulator that simulates a bank with multiple tellers and multiple queues where anyone can jockey from one que to another at any time.

This is an event driven simulation. It uses multiple streams of exponentially distributed waiting times. Finally it generates log of series of events from which various analyses can be performed.
